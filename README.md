# K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. By identifying distinct customer groups, the model helps businesses understand shopping behavior, target high-value segments, and personalize marketing strategies. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), optimal cluster selection using the Elbow Method, and visualization of customer clusters along with their centroids.
